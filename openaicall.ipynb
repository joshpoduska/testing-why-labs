Model Outputs: LLMs generate text-based outputs, while traditional ML models typically produce numerical or categorical predictions. Monitoring LLMs focuses on assessing text quality, relevance, sentiment, toxicity, and other language-specific metrics.\\n\\n2. Data Inputs: LLMs often require prompts or context to generate responses, making it important to monitor the quality and appropriateness of these inputs. Traditional ML models may not have this prompt-response dynamic and may rely on structured or unstructured data inputs.\\n\\n3. Metrics and Modules: WhyLabs provides specific modules and metrics tailored for LLM monitoring, such as text quality (readability, complexity), text relevance (similarity scores), security and privacy (jailbreak attempts, prompt injections), and sentiment/toxicity analysis. Traditional ML models may focus on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance.\\n\\n4. Use Cases: LLM monitoring is particularly relevant for applications involving natural language processing, chatbots, language translation, and content generation. Traditional ML models are commonly used for tasks like image recognition, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and time series forecasting.\\n\\nIn summary, monitoring LLMs with WhyLabs involves assessing text quality, relevance, and security/privacy aspects specific to language models, while monitoring traditional ML models focuses on more general metrics and use cases.'"

Monitoring input data: By monitoring the quality and distribution of the input data, you can identify potential issues that may affect the model's performance. This can include monitoring for data drift, missing values, outliers, or changes in data patterns.\\n\\n2. Monitoring output data: If you have access to some form of labeled data, you can compare the model's predictions with the ground truth labels to identify any discrepancies or errors. This can help you detect issues such as misclassifications or bias in the model's output.\\n\\n3. Monitoring performance metrics: Even without ground truth, you can still monitor the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. By tracking these metrics over time, you can identify any significant changes or deviations that may indicate a problem with the model.\\n\\n4. Monitoring feedback loops: If your model is deployed in a real-world system where user feedback is available, you can leverage this feedback to monitor the model's performance. User feedback can provide valuable insights into the model's behavior and help identify any issues or areas for improvement.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while these techniques can provide some level of monitoring without ground truth, having access to ground truth data is always preferable for more accurate and reliable model health monitoring.\""
