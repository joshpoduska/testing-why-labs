### A simple RAG-based QA LLM based on scraped public docs for Why Labs

Makes QA calls and then profiles and sends data to Why Labs for monitoring. The idea is to run the main notebook once a day so as to generate data over time to get a feel for how Why Labs works.

openaicall.ipynb is the main notebook
